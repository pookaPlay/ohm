I want pyrtl code for a bit-serial adder where the number of inputs is a parameter D. Assume that D is a power of 2. Each input is a twos complement bit-stream that will arrive in LSB order. The code should instantiate a tree of 2 input bs_add objects. The adder tree should produce a single output bit-stream. The test program should use pyrtl to simulate the object 1) serialize test data from python integers into a twos complement list 2) feed that through the BAT and collect an output list and 3) deserialize the output list into a python integer result. Ask questions if needed.
