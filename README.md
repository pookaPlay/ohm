# OHM: Ordered Hypothesis Machines

A new approach to digital neuromorphic computing based on Bit-Serial OHM (Ordered Hypothesis Machines) Neural Networks. The OHM Neural Network Node (or neuron) replaces the popular "weighted sum" + "nonlinearity" with a mutlipler-free node that is, by design, better for digital hardware. The Bit-Serial implementation of OHM Neural Networks reduces to a very simple data-flow architecture where data bit-streams alternate between least-significant-bit (LSB) and most-signifcant-bit (MSB) computation. 

Current development is focussed on bit-level-simulation
